### Inference Problems in Graphical Models

Given an undirected graphical model, i.e.
$$
p(x) = \frac{1}{Z} \prod_{C \in \mathcal{C}} \psi_C(x_C),
$$
where $\mathcal{C}$ denotes the collection of cliques, one is interested in the inference of the marginal distributions
$$
p(x_i) = \sum_{x_j, j\neq i} p(x).
$$

### Ingredients: Exponential Families

* Definition: We say $x$ is from an exponential family provided that the parametrized collection of density functions satisfies:
$$
p(x;\theta) = \exp\left\{ \theta^T\phi(x) - A(\theta) \right\}, \qquad A(\theta)<\infty .
$$
Moreover, $phi$ is one of the sufficient statistics for $\theta$, see Larry Wasserman's lecture notes from 10/36-705 for more details and examples; and $A$ is usually known as the log partition function, which is convex and lower semi-continuous. Further, 
<d-math block>
\begin{aligned}
A(\theta) &= \log \mathbb{E}_{\theta} \left[ \exp\{\theta^T\phi(x)\}\tight], \\
\frac{\partial A(\theta)}{\partial \theta} &= \mathbb{E}_{\theta} \left[ \phi(x) \right]. 
\end{aligned}
</d-math>

* Parametrize Graphical Models as Exponential Family
For undirected graphical model, if we assume
$$
\log \psi_C(x_C) = \log \psi(x_C;\theta_C) = \theta_C^T \phi(x_C),
$$
and let
$$
A(\theta) = \log Z(\theta)
$$
then
$$
p(x;\theta) = \exp( \sum_{C \in \mathcal{C}} \theta_C^T \phi(x_C)- A(\theta)).
$$

### Ingredients: Convex Conjugate

* 
For a function $f$, the convex conjugate dual, which is also known as the Legendre transform of $f$, is defined as
$$
f^*(\mu) = \sup_{\theta} \{ \theta^T\mu - f(\theta)\},
$$
and the convex conjugate dual is convex, no matter the original function is convex or not, and
Moreover, if $f$ is convex and lower semi-continuous, then 
$$
f(x)) = \sup_{\mu} \{ \theta^T\mu - f^*(\mu)\}.
$$
